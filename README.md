# Tic-Tac-Toe

### [Live demo](https://s-hens.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Summary

This is the classic game of tic-tac-toe made in vanilla JavaScript. Users can choose from two difficulty levels: "easy", where the computer chooses its moves randomly, or "hard", where the computer chooses its moves intelligently.

Done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.
